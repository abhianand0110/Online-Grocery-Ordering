# Online-Grocery-Ordering
>  An Online Grocery Management System where the Admin can Add, Update and Delete products. The Groceries are divided into various Categories like Fruits, Vegetables, Chocolates, etc. A user can select a particular item to view the details, choose the number he/she would like to order and fill in his/her details like Name, Address, etc to buy a product.

> I have used HTML & CSS in the frontend, Java Server Pages for backend and SQLLite as database.
